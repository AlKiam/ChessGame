# Chess Game, made with OpenGL, written in plain C99

### What is this is game?
This is just a normal chess game. It has been written with slight variation of [my own "engine"](https://github.com/AlKiam/Insight), using only **C and OpenGL** and with other libraries.

The goal of this project is not making "the best chess game ever", even though, making a game like this is a very beginner project (because I'm almost a beginner), I think. This game, has been done as a hobby for practising OpenGL and my skills using C and Data Oriented Desing.

It is a lightweight chess game, that should be able to run on every PC nowadays. 

### For what can I use this?

You could use the game to play chess, thats okay, but is not the only propouse. In my understanding, this game could be use as good interface for some AI testing, using the base engine to make your own isometric game, etc.
Your limit is whatever you could imagine (very clich√©, i know).
