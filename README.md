# Chess Game, made with OpenGL, written in plain C99

### What is this is game?
This is just a normal chess game. It has been written with slight variation of [my own "engine"](https://github.com/AlKiam/Insight), using only **C and OpenGL** and with other libraries.

The goal of this project is not making "the best chess game ever", even though, making a game like this is a very beginner project (because I'm almost a beginner), I think.

It is a lightweight chess game, that should run on every PC nowadays. 

### For what can I use this?

You could use the game to play chess, but thats not the actual point. In my understanding, this game could be use a good interface for some AI testing, using the base engine to make your own isometric game, etc.
Your limit is whatever you could imagine
